<h3>: Diamond Information: Plotting and Data Transformation - R</h3>

<p><strong>Log-transforming diamond price and carat improved regression assumptions and model fit.</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Fitted multivariate regression with price predicted by carat, cut, clarity, and color; Residuals vs. Fitted plot showed patterns indicating assumption violations.</li>
  <li>Normal Q-Q plot revealed deviations from normality of residuals, questioning regression assumptions.</li>
  <li>Scatter plot matrix indicated some non-linear relationships among variables.</li>
  <li>Log-transformation of price and carat improved Residuals vs. Fitted plot by reducing heteroscedasticity and enhancing linearity.</li>
  <li>Normal Q-Q plot after transformation showed residuals closer to normal distribution, indicating better model validity.</li>
</ul>
